# Selection Sort in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Selection Sort** algorithm, a simple comparison-based sorting method:

1. Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array.
2. Places the minimum element at the beginning of the sorted portion.
3. Sorts numbers in **ascending order**.

It displays the array before and after sorting to help visualize how selection sort organizes the elements.

## 🔧 Features

- **Step-by-Step Sorting**: Selects and places the minimum element in its correct position.

- **Simple Implementation**: Uses nested loops for clarity.

- **Array Input**: Works with any array of integers defined in the code.

- **Fully Commented Code**: Easy to understand and modify.

## 📋 Example Run

**Input:**
Original array:
64 25 12 22 11

**Output:**
Sorted array:
11 12 22 25 64

## ⚙ How It Works

1. **Iterate Through Array**
   - The outer loop selects the position where the next minimum element should go.
2. **Find Minimum Element**
   - The inner loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
