# Selection Sort in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This C++ program demonstrates the **Selection Sort** algorithm, a simple comparison-based sorting method:

1. Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array.
2. Places the minimum element at the beginning of the sorted portion.
3. Sorts numbers in **ascending order**.

It displays the array before and after sorting to help visualize how selection sort organizes the elements.
